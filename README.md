ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Wendy, a coding enthusiast and student currently pursuing my studies in software development. I love exploring the outdoors, and when I'm not immersed in coding, you can find me mountain biking or walking my two dogs.

ðŸŒ± I started my tech journey a year ago and have gained foundational knowledge in programming languages like PHP, JavaFX, Kotlin, and Arduino. Iâ€™m continuously expanding my skills and eager to take on new challenges.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m interested in collaborating on projects that suit my skill level. Whether contributing to open-source initiatives or working on personal projects, I'm excited to apply what I've learned and learn from others.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out here on GitHub if you'd like to connect, discuss potential collaborations, or chat about coding and outdoor adventures.

âš¡ Fun fact: Although I'm in my late 30s, I often feel like a newbie in coding. But with every line of code I write, Iâ€™m reminded that itâ€™s never too late to learn something new!


### My Code Snippets

Check out [this code snippet](https://gist.github.com/wenstef/b4b78e35fc1fc8e8ba690c8da1de044a) I created for a school assignment. The assignment required a desktop application written in JavaFX. This code is part of the **DogDays** project, where users can track their dogs.
