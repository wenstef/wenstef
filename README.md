ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Wendy, a coding enthusiast with a passion for exploring the outdoors. When I'm not diving deep into the world of software development, you'll find me on the trails, enjoying the thrill of mountain biking or just simply walking my two dogs.

ðŸŒ± I embarked on my journey into the tech world a year ago and haven't looked back since. My education program has equipped me with foundational knowledge in various programming languages including PHP, JavaFX, Kotlin, and Arduino. I'm continuously expanding my skill set and eager to tackle new challenges.

ðŸ’» I'm particularly interested in collaborating on projects that align with my current skill level. Whether it's contributing to open-source initiatives or working on personal projects, I'm keen to apply my skills and learn from others.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me here on GitHub if you want to connect, discuss potential collaborations, or just chat about our latest adventures in coding and mountain biking.

âš¡ Fun fact: Even though I'm in my late 30s, I often feel like a newbie in the coding world. But with every line of code I write, I'm reminded that it's never too late to learn something new and exciting. 

### My Code Snippets

Check out [this code snippet](https://gist.github.com/wenstef/b4b78e35fc1fc8e8ba690c8da1de044a) I created for a school assignment. The assignment required a desktop application written in JavaFX. This code is part of the **DogDays** project, where users can track their dogs.
